		A clean home is a happy home. I think about this statement a lot — especially as a cleaning editor. Allow me to reintroduce myself. 
		My name is Stephanie Nguyen, the cleaning and organizing editor for Apartment Therapy, and I love sharing and finding cleaning tips, organizational hacks, and decluttering tricks with you, our readers.
		<br><br>
		ORGANIZE & CLEAN
		<br><br>
		I know that the act of cleaning — from the chores you do every day to the ones done seasonally — goes beyond cleanliness. It’s how you care for your home, and in turn yourself. And when you declutter, it’s not just the usual suspects that pile up, 
		such as worn-out clothes or boxes upon boxes. Sometimes, you’re parting ways with the emotional memories that cling to the physical items of your spaces, like the T-shirt from my college newspaper days that I never wear but keep tucked away in a box or the 
		overflowing bin of handwritten notes, letters, cards, and post-its from people — old friends, coworkers, loved ones — that have at one point touched my life.
		Decluttering is often necessary as it allows you time to check in on your items and say goodbye to things that take up much-needed space (and time) or no longer bring joy into your life. Sometimes the toughest part of the decluttering process is knowing how and where to start.
		But, once you build momentum, you can tackle almost anything. 
		Luckily, you don’t have to do it alone. Apartment Therapy’s annual Decluttering Cure begins in just a few weeks — and it’s free to join in on the fun! This free 14-day program is designed to help you conquer the clutter in your home, step-by-step, and rejoice in a neater, more organized space. 
		The 2022 Decluttering Cure starts on Monday, Sept. 19, and you can sign up right now using the email signup box below.
